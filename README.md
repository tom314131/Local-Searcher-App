# Local-Searcher-App
* A Self-initiative project *
When we search a file in a folder by using Windows Search we can only open it directly. If we want to change the name of the file or open the folder of the file we always need to right click in the mouse.
So I created an app that has these options by one click only.
The app get a path and a key word, serach for the files that included the key word and give you three options: Open the file, Open the folder that includes the file, and change the name of the file.
